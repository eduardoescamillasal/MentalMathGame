## MentalMathGame

# This is a mental math game for mastering prime vs prime multiplications. 
- Since any number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers mastering the multiplication of any of the first 25 prime numbers by another one will theoretically make a anyone a mental calculator (provided that both numbers are up to two digits)
- Example: 62 x 26 =  ( 2 x 31 ) x ( 2 x 13) = 4 x **31 x 13** = 4 x **403** = 1612
